## 📘 About this project

This repository offers a comprehensive collection of YAML-based quiz questions to help to train based on the **Mirantis DCA Study Guide (2025)**.

The goal is to help candidates:
- Test their knowledge of Docker engine, networking, security, orchestration, image management, and more.
- Practice with high-quality, realistic multiple-choice questions.
- Navigate Docker and Mirantis documentation using provided links.

## 🧩 What's inside

- ✅ **YAML-formatted questions** with:
    - `uuid`, `question`, `answers`, `correct` flag
    - `help` field pointing to the official documentation when applicable
